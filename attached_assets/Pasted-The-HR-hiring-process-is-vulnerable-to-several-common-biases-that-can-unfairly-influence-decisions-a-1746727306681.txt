The HR hiring process is vulnerable to several common biases that can unfairly influence decisions and reduce workplace diversity. Here are the top biases found in hiring:

- Affinity (Similarity) Bias: Favoring candidates who share similar backgrounds, interests, or experiences as the interviewer or hiring manager[5][6][7].
- Confirmation Bias: Seeking out or interpreting information that confirms pre-existing beliefs about a candidate, while ignoring contradictory evidence[6][7].
- Halo Effect: Allowing one positive trait or impression (such as a prestigious school or confident demeanor) to overshadow other, possibly less favorable, aspects of a candidate[4][6][7].
- Horn Effect: The opposite of the halo effect-one negative trait unduly influences the overall evaluation of the candidate[6][7].
- Gender Bias: Making assumptions or decisions based on a candidate’s gender, often to the disadvantage of women or non-binary individuals[3][7].
- Racial or Ethnic Bias: Discriminating against candidates based on race or ethnicity, either consciously or unconsciously[3][7][9].
- Age Bias: Favoring or disfavoring candidates based on their age, regardless of actual ability or experience[3][6].
- Name Bias: Making judgments about a candidate based solely on their name, which can signal ethnicity or background[7].
- Anchoring Bias: Relying too heavily on the first piece of information received (such as a referral or first impression) and failing to adjust when new evidence arises[5].
- Attribution Bias: Attributing a candidate’s successes or failures to personality traits rather than situational factors, often unfairly[5].
- Illusory Correlation: Believing there is a meaningful relationship between two unrelated factors (e.g., thinking all good employees are “morning people”)[5][8].
- Contrast Bias: Evaluating candidates relative to each other instead of against the job requirements, which can distort perceptions[7].
- Conformity Bias: Allowing group opinions or “groupthink” to sway individual assessments of candidates[4][8].

These biases can occur at any stage of the hiring process, from resume screening to interviews and final decision-making. Addressing them is essential for fair, effective, and inclusive hiring practices[6][9][10].
