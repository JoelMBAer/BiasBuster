Bias Buster: HR Interview Simulator
Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an immersive, educational HR interview simulation game called Bias Buster. The game will help users understand how unconscious bias can affect hiring decisions by simulating the recruitment of candidates for a fictional company. The player acts as the HR manager and must select candidates over a series of rounds. Each round presents 3 randomly generated candidate profiles, and the player must interactively explore each before making a hiring decision. The game lasts for 5 rounds, allowing the player to build a small team. At the end of the game, they receive interactive feedback on their hiring patterns and the resulting impact on team diversity and performance. The simulation emphasizes reflection, learning, and awareness-building around fair and inclusive recruitment practices, with branching outcomes, gamified progress, and dynamic content that varies each session for replayability.
Objectives and Goals
Educate users on the impact of unconscious bias in hiring.
Provide a fully interactive and engaging simulation.
Offer measurable outcomes through real-time diversity and performance feedback.
Encourage reflection, behavioral insight, and growth.
Run entirely on Replit with minimal setup, using HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or Python + media-based UI).
Target Audience
HR professionals
Recruiters
Functional Requirements
Simulation Flow Upgrade
Each round includes:
Resume review with clickable tabs (Education, Experience, Skills, References)
Hover-reveal "gold star" or "red flag" icons based on resume cues
Short interview media (text/audio/video)
One follow-up question option per candidate with prebuilt answer choices
Behavioral variation (tone, emotion, body language) if media is used
Real-time reflection prompt (e.g., multiple choice + optional textbox):
“What influenced your decision most?” (Name, school, tone, etc.)
Candidate Generation
Randomized candidates with:
Name
Gender identity
Age group
Years of experience
Education background
Soft skill phrase (e.g., "Excels in emotional intelligence during conflict")
Interview quote (diverse, bias-aware, context-rich)
System Feedback
Post-hire:
Reflection capture form (optional journaling)
After 3 rounds:
Interactive Dashboard with:
Top 3 unconscious influences (clickable icons with examples)
Overlooked strengths vs. selected attributes
Consistency heatmap (visual streaks or clusters)
“What If Simulator”: Replay one decision and compare alternate outcomes
Final round:
Summary cards with:
Team stats (gender/age/education diversity)
Bias Score (pattern detection with explanation popups)
Performance Predictor Graph (compare your team to ideal data-driven hires)
“Why It Matters” insight bubbles (e.g., overreliance on one trait)
Rewind & Rethink button (1 decision per 3 rounds)
Realistic Behavioral Triggers
Triggered dialogue moments: ethical dilemma, vague answer, overconfidence, etc.
Urgency Mode randomly introduced to simulate high-pressure decision-making
Optional peer scoring overlay post-game to compare anonymized results
Learning Boosters
Flashcard Pop-ups: Quick facts (e.g., “Name bias affects 1 in 4 hiring decisions.”)
Micro-Intervention Tips: Tailored suggestions based on your hiring behavior
Gamification Layer:
Levels: Novice Recruiter → Bias Buster → Inclusion Architect
Badges for Fairness, Growth, Insight, and Correction
Streaks like: “3 unbiased hires in a row!” or “First time rethinking a choice”
Non-Functional Requirements
Fast-loading and browser-based (HTML/JS ideal)
No login required (guest access with session memory)
Mobile-friendly UI
Smooth interaction, simple onboarding, and readable visuals
User Stories
US-001: As a player, I want to explore candidate details through tabs and cues.
US-002: As a player, I want to ask follow-up questions to deepen candidate evaluation.
US-003: As a player, I want timely reflections and nudges to learn in-the-moment.
US-004: As a player, I want feedback that shows my blind spots clearly.
US-005: As a player, I want to earn rewards for thoughtful and fair hiring.
US-006: As a player, I want to optionally see how my choices compare with peers.
Acceptance Criteria
Profiles display in interactive, expandable cards
Red flags/gold stars trigger tooltips when hovered
Reflection prompts appear immediately after decision
Dashboards appear with interactive graphs and outcome simulators
Gamification and badge system functional and visible
All educational interventions appear at logical intervals
Assumptions and Constraints
Simulation assumes English-language input/output
Only one decision allowed per round unless using "Rethink" token
Peer comparison is anonymized and opt-in
Candidate pool is limited per game session, regenerated each replay
Out of Scope
Multi-user collaboration or real-time interviewing
Voice synthesis, video production from scratch
External API integrations (e.g., real resume databases)
User Interface Plan
Landing Screen: Start Game, Instructions, and Info button
Candidate Review: Three interactive cards per round with tabs and hover zones
Decision Screen: Select candidate, see red/gold highlights, ask follow-up
Reflection Screen: “Why did you choose this person?” prompt + feedback
Midpoint Dashboard: Graphs, consistency meter, "What If" simulator
Final Review Screen: Team breakdown, bias score, performance predictor, badge earned
Flashcards/Badges: Pop-ups or sidebar reveal after major actions
