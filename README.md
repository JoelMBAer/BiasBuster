An interactive educational simulation designed to help HR professionals identify and mitigate unconscious bias in hiring decisions.

## üåü Project Overview

The Bias Buster HR Interview Simulator is a gamified learning platform that uses realistic candidate profiles and AI-powered analysis to reveal potential unconscious biases in hiring practices.

- **Reflection System**: Self-report on what factors influenced each hiring decision
- **Educational Popups**: Learn about specific bias types after each selection

### Analytics & Insights
- **Decision Consistency Heatmap**: Visualize your selection patterns across different factors
- **Bias Pattern Detection**: AI-powered analysis of potential unconscious biases in selections
- **What-If Simulator**: Explore how different hiring choices would affect team composition
- **Team Demographics Dashboard**: Monitor diversity metrics as your virtual team grows

### Educational Tools
